# E-Commerce Back End

## Description
This back-end application is intended to be used for e-commerce. By being able to access the different API categories, the user can input new data, retrieve data and delete data. In this streamlined application, the user can also connect to mySql via the sequelize NPM package and populate the data in their tables, which makes life much easier than manually inserting the data.
